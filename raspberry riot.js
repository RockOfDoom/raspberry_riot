C'mon in,\" she said to him. \"Everyone's here already.\"","\n","^\"Hello Mrs. Nisim,\" he said. \"I'm Isaac.\" All the furniture was a cozy fit in the room.

He went through a door on the left.","\n","^The room was obviously cleaned today. The walls were painted a soft blue color.

The walls were empty save for a heavily marked calendar over the desk.","\n","^\"You can sit there.\" Lee pointed to the chair by the desk.","\n","^\"Thank you.\" Isaac said.
