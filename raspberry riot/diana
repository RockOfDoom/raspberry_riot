Clad in red and black streetwear slightly hidden behind an oversized rust colored duster, Pepper stomped into the room and stopped. She squinted at the two bright lights above the desk, grabbing a pair of aviators from a mess of bent and dirty sunglasses in her duster pocket. Her face went from an uncomfortable scowl to a somber tired look as she sat down and crossed her arms, facing the interviewer.

She nodded in recognition of the interviewer sitting across from her, as if she hadnâ€™t noticed that they were even present until now.

The interviewer pulls out a list of questions from a pile of vanilla and yellow folders on their desk.

"I had been alone for so long."

Pepper gripped the collar around her open jacket and pulled up, resting her chin on the flats of her fists. Focused on some object miles away below the table.

"I realized that I was able to do more than just push people away," her teeth clenched and her expression became somber before quickly disappearing into a content smirk, "I could pull things too. I didn't even have to touch them."

- "Because I have to,"

Her hands crossed on the table became tight fists.

"whether they want me ALWAYS around or not."

Her eyes darted quickly to the side, dragging her head slightly with them.

"They need me."

{team_trust == team_trust.trusting:
She leaned forward over the edge of the desk, "This group means more to me than you will ever know, I have to make sure that they are safe from anything or anyone that might split us apart."

She quickly snapped back into a relaxed state, adjusted her glass, and leaned back in the chair.

- "It's a berry too you know..."

She let out a light chuckle that quickly subsided to a sharp look, as if she had practiced her answer many times before.

"Might not be the sweetest but it's still a berry."

 ==pepper_q4==
- "I can push and pull things just by thinking about them. Not much to it."

Pepper stared at her wrist, a bracelet with three different colored beads laced within a braided chain, and it began to spin on its own. A dark red aura shimmers around it as it rotates slowly.

The bracelet fell limp on her wrist and the red aura disappeared.

"No. These ones just came with it."

Her hand disappeared behind the edge of the desk out of sight, her eyes dodging Issac's gaze.  

Pushing her anymore about this will probably lead nowhere.

 ==pepper_q5==
 
- "I've never been big into talking."

She leaned back sharply in her chair, looking up towards the ceiling.

"If you want someone to pour their heart out to you, ask Seaglass, not me."

She crossed her arms and looked down towards the table, still leaning back as if bracing to hit a pool of water from some great height.
