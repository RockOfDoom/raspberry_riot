Magical Seaglass Soldier Huckleberry, or Serena Linkle to her classmates.

16 years old. She's always in all of the plays at her high school, but everyone says the only people she really talks to are the other Raspberry Riot girls. 

No external friends or social life to speak of, yet in the field she's generally considered the flashiest showgirl of the team.

Serena stalks into Lee's room, looking fairly tired. She's wearing a pale blue hoodie that's much too big for her, some worn-out jeans, and some unremarkable sneakers.

Before Isaac can even get a word in she silently moves to the center of the room, pulls a light purple crystal out of her hoodie pocket, and exclaims "Magic Crystal Berry, Transformation!"

A bright teal-green light fills the room, and Serena lifts into the air glowing with power. She begins to spin gracefully, like a ballet dancer, and her hair comes unboundâ€”floating around her face like she's underwater. A sea-green ribbon ties itself in the back of her hair, and a shimmering seaglass necklace appears around her neck. Water droplets appear in the air around her, and flow onto her body, sparkling and forming an ornate and lace-covered skirt and blouse set. Her legs are covered in tight white leggings covered with tiny gleaming clear beads; her shoes are replaced by a pair of small, rounded high heels with little teal ribbon-bows on the front. Finally, she throws her crystal into the air, where it twirls and transforms into a magical staff. She catches it as it falls, and twirls it as she returns to the ground.

When she touches down, Serena cheerfully spouts "Magical Seaglass Soldier Huckleberry, at your service!"

* [Thank Serena for the demonstration.] "That was a wonderful demonstration of your powers! Thank you."
    "Of course!" Serena, no, Huckleberry replies. She gives a brief curtsy.

* [Tell Serena she didn't have to transform yet.] "Oh, I appreciate the thought but that won't be strictly necessary for this interview. If you would feel more comfortable out of costume, feel free." Isaac explained.
    "Well, I expect you came here to speak with Huckleberry, not Serena, yes? She IS the more interesting of the two."
    "I'm happy to speak with both, whichever way will make this easier for you." replied Isaac.
    "If it's the same either way," said Huckleberry, "I'd prefer to stay in costume."
    "That works for me." Isaac says.

* [Refrain from commenting.] Isaac decides to not linger too long on the transformation and get right into the interview.

==serena_q1===

"About 10 months, give or take." Huckleberry states. 

"That's not long after the alien attack on your school, was there some sort of connection?" the reporter gently prods.

"Yeah." There's a long pause, like Huckleberry is deciding whether she even wants to elaborate. Eventually, she continues: "I...got my powers towards the end of the attack, and then there were some openings so..."

She trails off, and looks like she doesn't want to continue.

"It's...I dunno." Huckleberry shifts her skirt uncomfortably. "I don't really like to talk about it."

Isaac recognizes a dead end when he sees one.

==serena_q3===

Huckleberry stands up a little straighter and puts on a radiant smile.

"Well, I had to come up with a lot of names to make sure the one I picked would fit with the team theme, you know?" she spouts with surprising energy. "Ultimately, 'Magical Seaglass Soldier Huckleberry' just fit the best between my powers and my space in the team. Plus, it's just fun to say, isn't it?"

As she says so, she makes a small gesture that causes her glass necklace to sparkle and chime. The reporter suspects that this is on purpuse.

==serena_q4===

Huckleberry's glass necklace chimes as she sits forward in her seat. "Well, my basic power is that I can control water. It's classic stuff, but if you know how to catch the light and make it sparkle it can still look pretty spectacular."

She straightens a little and claps her hands. When she separates them glittering teal water droplets fill the air between them. "But this is the really special stuff. I call them 'Lovely Crystal Tears', and I can make them.." she flourishes her hand and a line of sparkling water is sketched into the air, "out of thin air!"

She sits back, and continues more casually: "I can use the Tears to heal the other girls, and they're also good for blocking magic and lasers and other things like that."

Huckleberry looks quite pleased with herself.

"Oh, they're all lovely." says Huckleberry.

"Strawberry is cute enough to kill, and not half bad at her job either. Everyone likes her, though, so nothing special there..." Huckleberry muses.

"Pepper can be a little standoffish but she's sweet once you get to know her, she always has your back when you need her." she continues.

"YoungOGSavage is definitely a character. I think we get the most questions about him, but he's fun to have around and he has a great work ethic."

"And Raspberry Jam. Well, we don't always see eye to eye about how the team should be run but," Huckleberry haughtily flips some of her hair out of her face, "I still never doubt that he has everyone's best interests at heart."

"Honestly?" Huckleberry starts, "It's kind of exciting."

"It definitely used to be scarier, back when we were up against King Goregamesh, but ever since we handled him the monsters have been way less dangerous." She tapped her staff against the ground firmly, {monster_knowledge == girl_making_monsters:almost like she was trying to convince herself.}{monster_knowledge < girl_making_monsters:as if to emphasize her point.}

"But nowadays," she continued, "the guys we fight are kind of goofy. Last week, someone's pet lobster tripled in size and we had to catch it and return it to them." Huckleberry covered her mouth with the back of her hand to hold in a laugh. "They couldn't shrink it back, so they just got it a bigger tank! I guess some people will do anything for their pets...so strange."

"I still don't know what they did about the laser eyes though, that seems like that would make keeping it IN the tank much harder."

"Thank you, that's all the questions I had." says the reporter. "It was a pleasure to meet you, and to speak with you!"

"O-oh, likewise!" stutters out Huckleberry. She shakes the reporter's hand, and the reporter moves on to the next order of business.
