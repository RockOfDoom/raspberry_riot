Magical Seaglass Soldier Huckleberry, or Sebastian Linkle to his classmates.

16 years old, he's always in all of the plays at his high school but everyone says the only people he really talks to are the other Raspberry Riot girls. 

No external friends or social life to speak of, yet in the field he's generally considered the flashiest showman of the team.

The reporter knows a tough nut to crack when they see one, and boy do they see one sitting in front of them.

"About 10 months, give or take." 

Huckleberry mumbles. His nervous demeanor and hesitance to make eye contact clash with his extravagant blue skirt and gleaming glass necklace.

"That's not long after the alien attack on your school, was there some sort of connection?" the reporter gently prods.

"Yeah." There's a long pause, like Huckleberry is deciding whether he even wants to elaborate. Eventually, he continues: "I...got my powers towards the end of the attack, and then there were some openings so..."

He trails off, and looks like he doesn't want to continue.

"It's...I dunno." Huckleberry shifts his skirt uncomfortably and adjusts his position in his seat. "I don't really like to talk about it."

The reporter recognizes a dead end when they see one.
